# 🧪 CollegeCodebase — A ChemTech Code Archive

> A structured logbook of codes, graphical plots, caffeine-fueled debugging and a lot more.
> Where chemical reactions meet Python functions — with comments.

## 💡 Why This Repo?

This repo is a **clean, public archive** of the programming skills I developed during my **Integrated Masters of Technology in Chemical Technology** at **Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai – Marathwada Campus, Jalna (MarJ, in short)**.
It's intended as a reference for peers, juniors, and curious engineers who want to decode the ChemEng syllabus, line by line — in **Python**.

If you’re here for the raw code snippets, or creative experimental chaos, visit [`SudoChem`](https://github.com/mridun-gupta/sudochem) — that’s where the wild stuff lives.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Currently riding solo with:

- 🐍 **Python 3.x**

More stacks might sneak in soon, if the curriculum doesn’t rust *me* first.

## 📚 What You'll Find

- 📂 **Currently:** Python scripts focused on core **Mathematics** topics — clean, tested, and sorted
- 🔜 **Coming Soon:** Coursework-related subject-specific simulations, plots, programs, and codes developed as I progress through my academic journey
- 🧪 **Chem + Code Vision:** A long-term archive where chemical formulas and code functions stay in harmony
- 🗂️ **Always Organized:** All files are meticulously structured to keep entropy near zero—because chaos belongs in quantum theory, not my folders

The code is clean, commented, and reproducible — made to teach *and* survive viva questions.
