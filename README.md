## 💡 Why This Repo?

This repo is a **clean, public archive** of the mathematical computational codes I developed during my **Integrated Masters of Technology in Chemical Technology** at **Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai – Marathwada Campus, Jalna (MarJ, in short)**.
It's intended as a reference for peers, juniors, and curious engineers who want to decode the ChemEng syllabus, line by line — in **Python**.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Currently riding solo with:

- 🐍 **Python 3.x**

---

## 📚 What You'll Find

- **Numerical Methods:** Lagrange interpolation, Bisection, Regula Falsi, Newton-Raphson (drag coefficient & Van der Waals)
- **Initial Value Problems:** Euler method, Modified Euler, Runge-Kutta (RK2, RK4)
- **Boundary Value Problems:** Finite Difference methods
- **Partial Differential Equations:** Heat equation (FTCS, Crank-Nicolson), Wave equation
- **Basic Bank ATM System modeling**

- 🗂️ **Always Organized:** All files are meticulously structured to keep entropy near zero—because chaos belongs in quantum theory, not my folders

The code is clean, commented, and reproducible — made to teach *and* survive viva questions.
